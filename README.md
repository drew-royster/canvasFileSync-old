# *NOTE*

_I'm deep in the middle of an intensive rewrite using webpack-vuetify and all the best practices. Rather than running building off this code, sit tight and help build/fork a much easier to use version with bug fixes galore_

# Canvas File Sync

When using Canvas, I found that constantly downloading new files, updated files and then organizing those files was a huge pain. This program aims to work by having Google Drive like functionality with Canvas so that you never have to worry about being up to date or how you have organized things, because they will be organized on your computer just as they are organized on Canvas.
